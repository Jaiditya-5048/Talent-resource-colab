					Number of Approaches to Open the File
			===================================================
=>In Python Programming, we have Two Approaches to Open the Files. They are

			1. By using open() .
			2. By using "with open() as ".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. By using open() .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Syntax:     varname=open("File Name","File Mode")
------------------
Explanation
-----------------
=>varname---->Represents a valid variable name and It is an object of type <class, _io.TextIOWrapper>
			 this object always points to File and It is called File Pointer.
=>open()------->It is used for Opening the Specified File Name by using Specified File Mode
=>File Name--->represents Name of the File
=>File Mode--->Can be of one of the  r,w,a,r+,w+,a+,x, x+
=>Once we open any file name with open() then we must close the File by using close() and It is  mandatory for maintaining  Consistency of Data(Manual Closing--- there is no concept of Auto-Closeability).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. By using "with open() as ".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:     with open("File Name","File Mode") as varname:
				-------------------------------------------
				-------------------------------------------
				Block of Statements
				Performs Operations on Files
				-------------------------------------------
				-------------------------------------------
		  ----------------------------------------------------
		 Other Statements in Program

==================
Exaplanation
==================
=>Here "with" and "as" are the Keywords.
=>Here Varname Represents a valid variable name and It is an object of type <class, _io.TextIOWrapper>
			 this object always points to File and It is called File Pointer.
=>open() is used for Opening the File in Specified File Mode
=>FileName Represents Name of the File to be specified by the Programmer
=>File Mode Represents any one of the File Opening Modes ( r,w,a,r+,w+,a+,x,x+)
=>The execution Process of "with open(---) as " is that "As Long as PVM present in side of " with open(---) as " Indentation then File Name is actively Available and once PVM comes out of " with open(---) as" Indentation then File name closed Automatically and This Facility is Called Auto-Closeability of File". No Need to close the  file by using close() manually.
