					Real Time applications Developed by using PYTHON Programming Lang
				====================================================================	
=>By Learning PYTHON Programming Lang with Some Combination of Technologies,we can develop the following 
   Real Time Applications	

				1. Development of Web Applications(Web Sites---www.osmania.ac.in, www.jntuh.ac.in)
							a) Java Programming Lang----------Tech: JDBC,SERVLETS,JSP, HIBERNATE, 
							                                                           SPRING,SPRING WITH MICRO SERVICES, SPRING BOOT...etc
							    (Sun MS INC--->Oracle corp)
							
							b) C#.net Programming  Lang------Tech: ASP.NET CORE ASP.NET ADV, 
															   ASP MICRO SERVICES...etc
							    (Micro Soft INC USA
							
							c) PYTHON Programming Lang-----Tech: DJango, Flask,Bottle, pyramid...etc
							                        This is Most Powerful Lang, Bcoz Python Provides Many MODULES
										for Re-Using the Code--so that we write Less lines with more Meaning
								
				2. Developmnt of Gaming Applications 
				3. Development of Artificial Intelligence Application (AI)
								a) Machine Learning Applications
								b) Deep learning Applications
				4. Development of Image Processing applications
				5. Development of Audio and Video Based Applications
				6. Development of Bussiness Applications 
				7. Development of Web Scrapping / Web Harvesting Applications
				8. Development of Scientific Applications------NASA
				9. Development of Software Development (project for ICICI, SBI...etc)
				10. Development of OS Installers
				11. Development of Language Development (Scala, Spark )
				12. Develoment of Desttop GUI Applocations.
				13. Development of Data Analysis and Data Analytics(EDA Projects--
				14. Development of Automation of Testing
				15. Development of Complex Math Calculations
				16. Development of CAD and CAM Based Applications
				17. Development of Computer Vision
				18.  Development of  IOT 
				19. Development of Data Visualization.
				20.  Used in Education Systems  ....etc
